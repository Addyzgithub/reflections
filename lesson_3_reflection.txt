When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I would do that if I want to keep a backup of my repository online or if I use multiple devices to write code or if I am doing a project in collaboration with other people or if I want to share my entire project (including history) with public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Some commits might include minor changes that might not make a huge impact on our project as a whole. So manually pulling (and pushing) the changes whenever a major change is made seems beneficial as it might reduce the clutter.
