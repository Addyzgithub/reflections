Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git creates a hidden directory in current working directory which contains the meta-data needed for version controlling.
This is necessary to tell git we want to start tracking of some of/all the files in that directory and its sub-directories.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Staging area is an intermediate temporary state of our commit before we save it to our repository.
This allows us to define which files we want to include in the commit and also the message of commit which summarizes the logic behind the commit.
